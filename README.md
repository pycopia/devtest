# General Purpose Device and System Test Framework

A generalized framework for testing systems of interconnected devices.

Provides a developer friendly API, reporting, and advanced debugging.

The framework models device types, models, interfaces, connections, and roles.
Group the devices models into a Testbed objects for use by generalized tests.
Test cases have easy access to this model to know about the testbed and device
attributes. Test cases may therefore be written more abstractly and function
properly in many testbed environments without change.
